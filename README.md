# Portfolio Website

This is the portfolio site I'm building as part of my Intro to Programming development journey. It reflects my leraning and growth and will continue to evolve as I recap all I've learned and incorporate new projects and skills.
This site was inspired by my peers and educators, and follows structure guidance from the HTML & CSS course by Jen Kramer on Frontend Masters.

More updates to come as I grow!
